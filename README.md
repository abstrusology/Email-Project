# Email-Project
That email project I've talked about

So I think a good first step is to get an example data set to work with and have folks start munging on it to get familiar
the nature of the data structure.  We should generally try to keep the data structure in tact, so mapping it back to live email
systems will be easier.

Start with this:  http://bit.ly/1LW6Z5F
And with Example 2 here:  http://bit.ly/1LW72hY

I'm going to try and get the Enron data into an mbox file then put it up in this repository for our example dataset.

An early step should also be a discussion about what are the prominent features in the data that should anchor the ui(that's abstract but hopefull it makes sense)
